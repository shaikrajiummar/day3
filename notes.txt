datatypes:-
1.primitive
2.non-primitive

operators:-
***********
- operators are special symbols whic used to perform operation on operands.
ex :-  2(operand1) + 2(operand2)

1.unary
2.binary
3.ternary (operand1 ? operand2 :operand3)

1.1 arithmatic 
1.2 assignment 
1.3 relational
1.4 logical 

1.1 arithmatic:- which performs operations such as,
        1.additional (concatenation :- joining of two or more string)
        2.substraction
        3.multiplication
        4.division
        5.modulus
        6.exponential
        7.increment(++)
                - pre-increment(++variable)
                - post-increment(variable++)
        8.decrement(--)

2.assignment operator:-
ex:- =
let a = 10;
additional assignment(+=)
substraction assignment(-=)
multiplication assignment(*=)
division assignment(/=)
mofulus assignment(%=)
exponential assignment(**=)

3.relational operator:-
- == , === , != , !== , > , >= , < , <=

- return type of relational operaots boolean values.

== - only checks value not a datatypes
=== - checks both data type and values.
!= - 

4.logical operators
&& , || , !
&& - both LHS & RHS true 
|| - anyone should be true
! - if true , it wil make false and vice-verse.

decision making statements:-
****************************
if 
if-else
else-if ladder
switch 
ternary condition

if:- 
- when only ione condition is there then we can use if.
- if block will work only for true statement.
if()
{
    
}

if-else:-
- if is a true statement
- else is a flase statment

looping statments:-
- iterating the block of code multiple times.
- for loop:-
-minimum iteration count is "0".
    synatx: -  for(intitialization ; condition ; updation)
                    {//statements}
- while loop
-minimum iteration count is "0".
syntax:- while(condition){//statment}
- do-while loop
-minimum iteration count is "1".
-sytax :- do{//statments}
            while(condition)

which loops are entry controlled loops and exit controled loops?
entry controlled loops - for loop , while loop
exit controled loop - do-while loop

functions:-
************
- functions is a building block of javascript.
- function is a block of code which is used to execute specific task.
- function is a non-primitive data type.
- functins can be reusable.

synatx :-  function function_name(optional parameters,a ){ // function delclaration
                                //statements
                                }
                        function_name(arguments);

types of function:-
*******************
1.named function:- function is having a name and invoked(calling) with the same name.
2.anonymus function:- a function which doesnot have a name for it .
                    - it cannot be executed by itself.
3.function expression:- an anonymus function body is assigned as a value to the variable
                        and same function will be invoked with the same vairable.
4.IIFE(immidiate invoke function expression):- 
- once function created immediatley it will called and executed.
- it can be invoked only ont time.
5.Arrow function :- it is introduced in es6 feature.
- it concise the normal function syntax.
- ()=>{};
- arrow function is similar to anonymus function.

6.Higher order function :- 
-higher order function is a function which accepts another function as an arguments/values.

7.callback function:-
- callback function is a function which is passed as a argument to another function.



Note:- current version of javascript is es14.
es - ECMA script .
ECMA - european computer manufacturing association.
- es6 feature is stable.

explicit return :- explicitly we have to give a keyword called as "return".
explciit return is possible in both normal function as well as arrow function.
implicit return:- implicitly(by default) arrow function will take return.
note:- no printing statements will work after "return" statement.

closure:-closure is a memory created when functions are bundled together/
nested each other by giving accessibility to the innermost function to access
the variables of outermost function.



Arrays :-
- it is a non-primitive data type.
- Array is used to store multiple values within a single variable.

syantx :-  [];

what is the difference between map and forEach method.
map() :- it is used to iterate the values.
        - it returns new copied array from the original array.

forEach() :- it is used to iterate the values.
          - it returns "undefined".

create array of objects
*************************



what is object?
- Object is an entity which contains states and behaviors.
-states - properties , behaviour - functionality.
- Object is an entity to store the values in the form key and value pair.

synatax :-   let obj = {};
ex :-   let userdetails ={
        name:"Sam",
        age:23
        }

Note: - Javascript is mainly object -based language till 2015 (es6) 
- after es6 feature they added oops concept.
json methods:-
**************
1.JSON.stringify() :-it is used to convert JS obejct into json object.
2.JSON.parse() :- it is used to convert json object into javascript object.

Asynchronous in javascript:-
****************************
- to perform multiple task at a time.

1.setTimeout() :- it is web api used to perform asyn operations with certain timeouts.
syntax :-   setTimeout(callbackfn , timeout);

2.setInterval() :- it is a web api used to perform async operation at every time interval specified.
synatx :-  setInterval(callbackfn , timeout);

3.promise :- Promise is an object which represents eventual completion or failures of async operations.
        states of promise:-
        1.pending state
        2.fulfilled state
        3.rejected state
        syntax :-    let x = new Promise((resolve , reject)=>{});

        to execute the promise we have instance methods:-
                1.then() :- it is used to execute success or fulfilled state results.
                2.catch() :- it is used to execute rejected state results.
                3.finally() :- once promise is settled it will print for both success/failures


4.async & await

note:- javscript is by default "Synchronous(single threaded)".

Create - POST
Read - GET
update - PUT
Delete - Delete



****
DOM:-
-DOM=stands for document object model
- Dpom is a web api used to manipulate the html content 
-DOM is ued to add, remove, update the content in the htmldocument
DOM methods:-
*************
1.document.getElementById(""):-

-it is used to select html element based on "id attribute" value.
-with id TTRIBUTE we can select only one element (unique element)

2.document.getElementByClassName(""):-

-it is used to select html element based on "class attribute" value
-with calss attribute we can select the multiple elements.

3.document.getElementByTagName(""):-

-it is used to select html element based on their tag names. 

4..document.getElementByName("")

-it is used to select  html element based on "name attribute".

5.document.querySelector(""):-
6.document.querySelectorAll();



Events
********

-events are nothing but an actions performed on the html element
- in dom , we have like events like click events,mouse events and key events
- clicl events:- onclick, andblclick,
